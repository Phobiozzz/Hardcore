He sleeps under black seas waiting
Lies dreaming in death
He sleeps under cosmos shaking
Stars granting his breath
He wakes as the world dies screaming
All horrors arrive
He wakes giving earth it's bleeding
Pure madness alive
And he haunts you
And he blinds your soul
And he loathes you
And reclaims it all

You turn to stone
Can't look away
You turn to stone
Madness, they say
Cthulhu awaken
He sways in abyss returning
Inhaling black skies
He shakes with a torture burning
All lost in his eyes
And he haunts you
And he blinds your soul
And he loathes you
And reclaims it all
You turn to stone
Can't look away
You turn to stone
Madness, they say
Cthulhuâ€¦
