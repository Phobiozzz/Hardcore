He sleeps under black seas waiting
Lies dreaming in death
He sleeps under cosmos shaking
Stars granting his breath
He wakes as the world dies screaming
All horrors arrive
He wakes giving earth it's bleeding
Pure madness alive
And he haunts you
And he blinds your soul
And he loathes you
And reclaims it all
